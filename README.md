# Zomato Clone
A #SwiftUI Project that attempts to clone the popular food ordering app Zomato. Making an app with SwiftUI requires essentially one codebase for iPhones, iPads and the Mac.

This project helped me solidify my SwiftUI Fundamentals and also allowed me to dive into new areas of this brand new
and super powerful declarative UI by Apple.
